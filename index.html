                        <h3>Paleontology</h3>
                        <p>
                            Paleontology is the study of prehistoric life. Paleontologists mostly deal with the remains of extinct animals or plants that have been fossilized are what paleontologists study.

                        <h3>Archaeology</h3>
                        <p>
                            Archaeology is the study of ancient human history. Archeologists mostly deal with artifacts, sites of human habitation, and the remains of humans or even animals the lived with people at the site.

                        <h3>What's the Same?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Both archaeology and paleontology are sciences of the past. Both involve lots of excavating of sites and the meticulous recording of the rock strata where anything is found in order to help with dating any material found.

                        <h3>What's the Difference?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Archaeology focuses on the human past, whereas paleontology focuses on the Earth's past. Archaeology is much more closely tied to anthropology (the study of humans and their behaviour, culture, etc.) due to the archaeology's focus on human history which can lead to much overlap between archaeology and anthropology. Paleontology exclusively focuses on the study of prehistoric biota, that is animals and plants. Although there is some overlap between paleontology and archaeology, such as the study of the last Ice Age where humans existed alongside now extinct animals (like woolly mammoths), the two are separate fields of science entirely.

                    <h2>Why Should You care? Or More Like, Why Do I Care?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Having studied archeology for two years and having a life long love for paleontology, it really annoys me whenever someone uses the two interchangeably or doesn't understand the difference between the two fields of study.
